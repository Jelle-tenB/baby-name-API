# Pick-A-Name (WIP)

Greetings dear readers, <br>
We are participants of Roads Technology and this our project to help others possibly pick a name for their child. Our [database](https://github.com/MatthiasWinkelmann/firstname-database) contains 45331 names and choosing between them can be quite the chore. So we made it possible to search / filter for names based on certain letters, gender and / or country. After making an account you can also swipe right (like) or swipe left (dislike) to save your preferences and compare them with your partner. <br>
Currently you can only have 2 people in a group and you can be in a maximum of 2 groups.
