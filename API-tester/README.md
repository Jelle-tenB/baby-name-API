# Pick-A-Name / Baby name Tinder (WIP)

## Description

Greetings dear readers,\
This is my first serious Python project and as such it might not be up to certain *standards*. Any and all feedback is welcome.

I have (hopefully) build a REST API connected to a SQLite3 database. With which you and your partner can find and *Like* first names to choose from.\
You can search for names based on gender, country, starting letter(s) and/or letter(s) anywhere in the name. After creating an account you can add the names you like to your account. When your partner has done the same, one of you can create a group and the other can join by providing the group code (limited to 2 people per group). Now that you are both in the same group you can get a list of names you **both** have liked and pick and choose from there.

The frontend for the website/app is currently being a build by someone else. When we are both happy with the result I will probably include it here too.
